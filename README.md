#How to play
Make sure the entire folder has been downloaded and open index.html in the browser of your choice.
Use the arrow keys to move to the other side without touching the bugs! At that point the game will end
and you will be prompted to play again. Touching a bug will cause your player to be moved to the starting
space.
